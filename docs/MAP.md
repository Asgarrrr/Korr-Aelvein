# Korr Aelvein — Codebase map

Read this **before** grepping or reinventing. Claude: this is your first stop when orienting in this repo.

## Folder structure

```
apps/
  client/             Vite 8 + React 19 SPA. Renders state, forwards input. NO game logic.

## Modules and their public surfaces

### `@korr-aelvein/typescript-config`

- Two presets: `base.json` (runtime-agnostic, no DOM) and `react-library.json` (extends base + DOM lib + JSX).
- All workspaces extend one of these. Don't add lib/types directly to per-app tsconfigs; modify the shared preset instead.
- Strict flags enabled: `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noImplicitOverride`, `noImplicitReturns`, `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`.

### `apps/server`

- **Entry point**: `src/index.ts` calls `createApp().listen(PORT)`. Re-exports `type App` for the client via Eden Treaty.
- **App builder**: `src/app.ts` — pure `createApp()` that returns the Elysia instance without listening. Use this from tests: `await createApp().handle(new Request(...))`.
- **WebSocket**: `/game` with TypeBox `body` and `response` schemas. Inbound validation is the security boundary of the server-authoritative model.
- **HTTP**: `/health` returns `{ ok: true }`.
- **Port**: `3000` (override with `PORT` env var; declared in `turbo.json#globalEnv`).
- **Game logic**: lives under `src/domain/`. Currently `rng/` (PRNG infra), `dungeon/` (procgen), and `game/` (tick loop).
- **Public package exports** (`package.json#exports`): `./src/index.ts` for both `types` and `import` conditions — that's how the client pulls `App` via `import type { App } from "server"`.

### `apps/server/src/domain/dungeon`

- **Public API**: `generateLevel(rng, w, h, style)`, `StyleId = "rim" | "caverns"`, `emptyLevel`, `runPipeline`, types (`Level`, `Tile`, `Grid`, `Room`, `Pass`, `Pipeline`), grid helpers (`idx`, `inBounds`, `getTile`, `DX4`/`DY4`).
- **Architecture**: pipeline of pure passes `(Level, Rng) => Level`. Each style is a `Pipeline = ReadonlyArray<Pass>` recipe. Adding a style = adding a folder under `styles/`.
- **Reproducibility**: same seed → byte-identical `Level`. 200 seed-runs pinned via FNV-1a hash regression (`styles/{rim,caverns}/tests/determinism.test.ts`).
- **Perf**: rim ~0.03 ms, caverns ~2 ms at 300×150 (~95× speedup vs initial O(N²) algorithm).
- **CLI**: `bun run preview --style {rim,caverns} --seed N` from `apps/server/`.
- **Full doc**: `docs/PROCGEN.md` covers passes, constraints, determinism contract, and rejected alternatives.

### `apps/server/src/domain/rng`

- **Public API**: `createRng(seed: number)`, `fromRngState(state: RngState)`, `Rng`, `RngCore`, `RngState`. High-level ops (`int`/`pick`/`chance`/`split`) live as methods on the `Rng` wrapper.
- **Lifecycle in reducers**: `const rng = fromRngState(state.rngState); … return { ...state, rngState: rng.state() };`.
- **Algorithm**: sfc32 (128-bit state) + SplitMix32 expansion. Pure 32-bit JS arithmetic, no BigInt. Identical sequences across V8/Bun and any modern browser.
- **Why this and not Mulberry32 / PCG / xoshiro / wyrand / ChaCha8**: see the docstring at the top of `index.ts` and `~/.claude/projects/-Users-asgarrrr-Documents-Projects-korr-aelvein/memory/project_design_decisions.md`.
- **Bench**: `bun run bench` (in `apps/server`). Reference: `next() ≈ 4.6 ns/op`, `pick(arr[10]) ≈ 36.5 ns/op` (O(n) is the cost of the no-`as`/no-`!` rule, accepted).

### `apps/client`

- **Entry point**: `src/main.tsx` mounts `<Game />`.
- **Eden client**: `treaty<App>(SERVER_URL)` instantiated once at module scope in `src/Game.tsx`. The client never re-declares WS message types.
- **WS connection**: opened in `useEffect`, cleanup closes the socket. React 19 StrictMode causes a dev-only double-mount; not a bug.
- **Build**: `tsc -b && vite build`. Output to `dist/` (gitignored).
- **Dev port**: `5173`.

## Don't reach for these — explicit rejections

Considered, deliberately not used. Re-read the rationale before challenging.

- **ESLint, Prettier** — replaced by Biome (single tool for lint + format + organise-imports). See `feedback_official_scaffolds.md`.
- **`as` casts, `!` non-null, `as const`, import-alias `import { X as Y }`** — banned project-wide. Refactor with `for…of` / `entries()`, runtime guards, or local renames. See `feedback_no_as_no_nonnull.md`.
- **Mulberry32** — superseded by sfc32 (period exhaustion at 2³², ~1/3 missing u32 outputs).
- **PCG / wyrand** — need 64-bit arithmetic → BigInt → 10–60× slowdown in V8. Not viable for browser-side determinism.
- **xoshiro128++** — known low-bit weakness, fails linear-complexity tests (Vigna's own docs).
- **ChaCha8** — overkill (cryptographic) and ~10× slower than sfc32 in pure JS.
- **External ECS libs (bitecs, miniplex, koota), Redux, Zustand, effect-ts, Result/Either libs** — premature for our scale and turn-based loop. We ship our own minimal sparse-set ECS at `apps/server/src/domain/ecs/`; see its README + conventions below.
- **Next.js, SSR, RSC** — client is and stays a Vite SPA targeting a Canvas/WebGL game.
- **Database, ORM, persistence layer** — server state lives in memory only, until explicitly asked otherwise.
- **`packages/game-core`** — not extracted preemptively. Trigger: same type duplicated between client and server. Until then, types live in `apps/server/src/domain/`.

For the full rationale of any item: `~/.claude/projects/-Users-asgarrrr-Documents-Projects-korr-aelvein/memory/project_design_decisions.md`.

## ECS conventions (`apps/server/src/domain/ecs/`)

The home-grown ECS is sparse-set, AoS storage, parity-encoded liveness, with `with`/`without` filters, lifecycle buffers, and typed event channels. Three feature families were deliberately rejected — each has revisit criteria so we don't relitigate.

### Relations (entity → entity) — convention, no native primitive

Use a regular component whose value carries the target's `EntityId`:

```ts
type ChildOf = { readonly parent: EntityId };
type OwnedBy = { readonly target: EntityId };
```

Inverse lookups (`who owns id X`?) iterate the relation column and filter — `O(N_relation)`, acceptable at N≤5000.

Why not flecs-style native pairs:
- Sparse-set AoS does not store archetype bitmasks; native pairs assume archetype indexing.
- ~5–10 % overhead per add/remove (hashmap pair lookup) — unjustified at our scale.

Revisit when **both** are true: a feature needs > 2 inverse lookups per tick at N≥1000, AND bench shows the convention costs > 5 % of the tick budget.

### Archetypes / fragmented_iter — rejected

Storage is one sparse-set column per component. Multi-key queries pivot on the smallest column and probe secondaries via `sparse.get`. Hot paths today are 1–2 keys (`[position]`, `[position, hp]`).

Why not EnTT-style groups:
- Owning groups reshuffle columns → breaks the "insertion order stable" invariant; complicates snapshot.
- Non-owning groups (parallel `Set<EntityId>` of matching entities) add maintenance per add/remove for unclear win at our scale.

Revisit when **both** are true: a 4+ key query appears in a real system (not hypothetical), AND bench shows it consumes > 5 % of the tick budget at N≥5000. Prefer non-owning groups (lightweight, no reshuffling).

### Hooks (`onAdd` / `onRemove` callbacks) — rejected

Sync component-lifecycle callbacks would break the pure-reducer model `(state, action) → state` and introduce reentrancy hazards (a callback that triggers `setComponent` re-enters the same code path). `drainEntered` / `drainExited` (lifecycle buffers) plus `defineEvent` / `emit` / `drain` cover every legitimate use case without these inconveniences. No revisit criteria — this one stays rejected.

## Setting (story / lore)

An island built around a vast inexplicable abyss whose presence shapes the world for unknown reasons. A town encircles the rim; people live, work, descend.

_Korr_ and _Aelvein_ are invented proper nouns — their referents (town, abyss, order, era, dynasty) crystallise as the lore is written. **Do not translate to English equivalents in code or copy.**
